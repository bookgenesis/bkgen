# bkgen/UserScripts

This folder contains InDesign scripts that can be used to simplify and accelerate publishing with InDesign. The scripts tie into the bookgenesis workflow — as seen, for example, in the use of tags in Notes.

To install the scripts, either link or copy the UserScripts folder into the InDesign user scripts directory.

1. **Find the InDesign user scripts directory:** In InDesign open the Scripts palette. Right-click on the "User" folder and select "Reveal in Finder/Explorer." This is the InDesign user scripts folder — it might be called "Scripts Panel" in the filesystem.

2. **Link or Copy the bkgen/UserScripts folder into the InDesign user scripts folder:**
    + **macOS:** Right-click on the bg-typesetter/UserScripts folder and select "Make Alias". Rename the alias to "bg-typesetter". Drag the alias and drop it insider the InDesign user scripts / "Scripts Panel" folder.
    + **Windows:** Click on the bg-typesetter/UserScripts folder to select it. Hold down the Alt key, then drag the folder and drop it (copy it, you should see a "+" by your mouse) into the InDesign user scripts / "Scripts Panel" folder. Too bad for Windows that its shortcuts don’t work here.
